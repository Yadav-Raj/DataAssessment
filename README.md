# Raj Yadav Xtern Fan Engagement Analysis

This project explores user behavior and engagement within a fan community. By analyzing data on factors like merchandise purchases and participation in fan challenges, we aim to develop strategies to:

1. Boost user engagement
2. Increase merchandise sales
   
This project utilizes Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data analysis and visualization.

## Data
The data for this analysis is loaded from a CSV file provided by Xtern. We perform some basic cleaning steps like removing missing values and converting specific columns for better handling.

## Analysis
We conduct various analyses to understand user behavior and identify potential relationships between factors. Here's a breakdown:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
          a. We generate descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution.
          b. A correlation matrix helps visualize relationships between variables.
2. Key Findings from EDA:
          a. Users who complete more fan challenges are more likely to purchase merchandise.
          b. Users with higher predictive accuracy tend to spend more time watching live events.
          c. There's a positive correlation between user activity in chat and ad clicks.
          d. Approximately 40% of users have purchased virtual merchandise.
4. Clustering Analysis:
          a. We use K-Means clustering to segment users based on their behavior.
          b. The elbow method and silhouette score analysis suggest 4 as the optimal number of clusters.
          c. Each cluster represents a distinct user group with unique characteristics.
   
## Proposed Fan Challenge
To increase engagement during live events and drive merchandise purchases, we propose the "Live 360 Engagement Challenge." This challenge encourages participation in live polls and discussions, rewarding users with points redeemable for exclusive virtual merchandise.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, here are some key recommendations:

1. Targeted Strategies: Develop tailored approaches for each user cluster based on their specific behavior and preferences.
2. Personalized Content: Leverage user data to deliver more relevant content to each user.
3. Community Building: Foster a more active and engaged community through chat and sponsored content.
4. Challenge Evaluation: Implement and track the proposed challenge to measure its effectiveness in driving engagement and sales.
5. Continuous Analysis: Regularly analyze user data to identify emerging trends and potential areas for improvement.

## Limitations
1. The analysis is based on a limited dataset.
2. The findings may not be generalizable to other fan communities.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into user behavior and the impact of fan challenges. By implementing the recommended strategies, we can create a more engaging and revenue-generating platform for the fan community.
